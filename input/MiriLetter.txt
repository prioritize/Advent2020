Dear Santa,
My name is Miri. I am 4 years old. I have been a very good girl this year.
For example, I have taken care of my brother when he is sad. I've gotten very good at sharing with my little brother as well.
I like to teach him words like "Please", "May I have water" and "candy"
Next year, I am going to be a very good girl. I am going to participate in Karate and learn how to read.
For Christmas this year I would like:
A remote control train,
An LOL doll (3),
I would like Calico Critters, 
A Barbie doll a baby doll, and a big big big dollhouse.
I want a toy castle that I can go in too.
I want beach stickers and a watch.
I also want to get my brother Dominic a PJ Mask toy.
I love you Santa
